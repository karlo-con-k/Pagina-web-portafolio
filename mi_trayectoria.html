                <p>  
                    I started my academic journey in high school. Where I chose to study mathematics 
                    in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Guanajuato, or DEMAT. 
                    However, I did not expect that the first year and a half of the degree would 
                    be the most difficult of my life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I started at DEMAT, I used to study around 5 hours for day. But I didn't
                    understand the class topics, while my classmates easily mastered the subjects. 
                    Even with increasing my efforts, I couldn't pass my courses. There is nothing 
                    that has hurt me more in life than giving it my all and fail. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I repeated my first semester courses. I decided that I would 
                    succeed or I would change my degree. Throughout the semester, I woke up at 7am 
                    to go to class, finished at 2pm my class, ate lunch and walked from 2pm to 3pm 
                    until I arrived at the cafe where I studied from 3pm to 12:00am, and then walked  
                    and ate on my way back home. Whenever I wanted to take a break, I read books on 
                    how to solve math problems or how to make proofs. I only rested on Friday nights. 
                    Thanks to that immense effort, I managed to pass my 
                    courses. Afterwards, each semester became easier than the previous one. 
                    Although I continued seeking challenges, such as taking master's level courses 
                    while in my fourth semester or attending summer schools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I decided to focus on Computer Science throughout my career. I took around 
                    50% of the courses for the Master's degree at CIMAT. Even though it would have 
                    been more comfortable for me to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science, 
                    I decided to step out of my comfort zone and look for a job in that field.
